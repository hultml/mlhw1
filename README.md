Download the repository as a zip by clicking the green button up and to the right. 

Then open a terminal and go into this folder (`cd mlhw1` from the folder above).

At the terminal type `pixi install`. That should install the prerequisites.

To work in jupyterlab type `pixi run jupyter lab .`. This will bring up
the jupyterlab interface in your browser. You can click on the notebook file to run it. 

Run the cells until it asks you to answer the 6 questions. Start answering them. You can use
AI, just mention where you did.

Make sure you save the notebook from time to time.

Upload (1) the notebook with questions answered (.ipynb file) and (2) a html file produced using the save-and-export submenu in the file menu.
